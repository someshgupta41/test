## Problem Description

  A group of `n` kids sit in a circle. Given a number `m`, start counting from one of the kids. The kid who counts the number `m` goes out of the circle. Continue from the next kid until there is only one kid left. Find out who is the last kid.

## Expected Completion Time

  - 25 min for C solution with linked list
  - 15 min for C++ solution with queue

## Problem Complexity Level

  Easy


## Questions the candidate might ask

  Can the `m` be larger than `n`? zero? one? - Yes, need to handle all cases of the unsigned int unput for both `n` and `m`.

## Sample inputs - Expected outputs
```
  1 -- 2 -- 3
  |         |
  6 -- 5 -- 4
```
  - 6 kids in a circle, counting number is 4, starting to count from 1st kid.
  - 1st kid out is #4
  - 2nd kid out is #2
  - 3rd kid out is #1
  - 4th kid out is #3
  - 5th kid out is #6
  - remaining kid #5


## Input corner cases

 `n` and/or `m` <= 1

## Solution

  Programmatic solution can be implemented as a circular linked list or queue, nodes are removed per counter.

  There is also rather complex math formula that can yield the final result.
  Math solution is _not_ required from the programmers, but may be brought up by the candidates with math/quant background.

  Note: This is an example of a [Josephus problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem)

  Formula:
```
  f(n, k) = ((f(n - 1), k) + k - 1) mod n) + 1, f(1, k) = 1
```
### Design


### Data structures

  Circular linked list, queue

### Implementation

"C" style solution using linked list

  ```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
  unsigned int num;
  Node* next;
};

unsigned int processNodeCircle(unsigned int max_nodes, unsigned int cntr) {

    Node *head = NULL, *cur = NULL, *prev = NULL;

    // handle corner cases

    if (!cntr || !max_nodes) {
        return 0;
    }

    if (cntr == 1 || max_nodes == 1) {
        return max_nodes;
    }


    // build circular list

    unsigned int num_nodes = 0;

    while (num_nodes < max_nodes) {

        ++num_nodes;
        cur = new Node();
        cur->num = num_nodes;
        cur->next = NULL;

        if (!head) {
            head = cur;
        }

        if (prev) {
            prev->next = cur;
        }

        if (num_nodes == max_nodes) {
            cur->next = head;
        }
        prev = cur;
    }
    // remove every cntr node

    unsigned int cur_cnt = 0;
    cur = head;

    while (num_nodes > 1) {

        ++cur_cnt;
        //cout << "num_nodes=" << num_nodes << " cur_cnt " << cur_cnt << " cur " << cur->num << endl;
        if (!(cur_cnt % cntr)) {
            // delete node
            prev->next = cur->next;
            cur->next = NULL;
            // cout << "deleting node " << cur->num << endl;
            delete cur;
            --num_nodes;
            cur = prev->next;
        } else {
          prev = cur;
          cur = cur->next;
        }
    }

    //cout << "Number of steps " << cur_cnt << endl;
    unsigned int ret = cur->num;
    delete cur;
    return ret;
}

  ```
Note: If the candidate states they are particularly proficient in C++/STL, then we can ask them detailed questions about their implementation (in comments below)

"C++" solution using std::vector

```C++
#include <vector>

size_t processCircle(size_t n, size_t m) {
  size_t rtn = 0; // default for edge cases

  if (n>0 && m>0) {
    // initialize vector of kids
    std::vector<size_t> vec(n);
    for (size_t i=0; i<n; ++i) {
      vec[i] = i+1;
    }

    // iteratively remove kids
    size_t idx = (m-1)%vec.size(); // -1 since we're counting from 1 not zero
    while (vec.size()>1) {
      vec.erase(vec.begin()+idx);
      idx = (idx+m-1)%vec.size(); // -1 since we're counting from 1 not zero
    }
    rtn = vec[0]; // identify the last child in the circle
  }

  return rtn;
}
```

"C++" solution using std::deque

```C++
#include <deque>
#include <numeric>

unsigned processCircle(unsigned const total_kids, unsigned remove_kid) {

  // Edge cases
  if (!total_kids || !remove_kid) {
    return 0; // Nothing to do
  }
  if (total_kids == 1) {
    return 1; // Already at the last kid
  }
  if (remove_kid == 1) {
    return total_kids; // Should always return the last value
  }

  // Deque is necessary because iota requires it
  // Deque can be replaced with Queue if iota is not used
  std::deque<int> values(total_kids);
  // Candidates familiar with the C++11 STL should know of iota
  std::iota(values.begin(), values.end(), 1);

  unsigned current_kid = 0;

  // Optimization: skip over N cycles of the loop in cases
  // where remove_kid>total_kids
  current_kid = remove_kid - (remove_kid%total_kids);

  while (values.size() > 1) {

    if (++current_kid % remove_kid) {
      values.push_back(values.front());
    } else {
      // Optimization: skip over N cycles of the loop in cases
      // where remove_kid > remaining kids
      size_t skipCnt = remove_kid - (remove_kid)%(values.size()-1); // -1 since deque is shrunk after this call
      current_kid += skipCnt;
    }

    values.pop_front();
  }

  return values.front();
}
```

"C++" solution using dynamic programming

```C++
unsigned processCircle(unsigned const total_kids, unsigned remove_kid) {
  int result=0; //for total_kids=1

  for(int i=2;i<=total_kids;i++)
  {
    result=(remove_kid+result)%i;
  }
  return (result+1);  //adding 1 to change indexing;
}
```

"C++" solution using recursion

```C++
unsigned processCircle(unsigned const total_kids, unsigned remove_kid) {
  if (total_kids<1 || remove_kid<0) {
    return 0;
  }

  if (total_kids == 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return (processCircle(total_kids - 1, remove_kid) + remove_kid-1) % total_kids + 1;
  }
}
```

Or the equivalent of the linked-list solution in Haskell:
```
remainingKid 1 n = n
remainingKid m n =
  let l = map snd $ filter fst $ zip (cycle (False : replicate (m-1) True)) ([0..n] ++ l)
  fst $ head $ filter (uncurry (==)) $ zip l (0:l)
```

### Runtime complexity

 General complexity is `O((n-1)m)`  - Eliminate `(n-1)` nodes, for each elimination need to do `m` steps. However, the solution can be optimized for the iterations where `m > cur_circle_size` to reduce number of steps to `m % cur_circle_size`.

### Memory usage

  `O(n)` No additional memory except original circle

## Test Driver

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "processCircle(6, 4) returned " << processCircle(6, 4) << " expected 5" << endl;
  cout << "processCircle(39, 18) returned " << processCircle(39, 18) << " expected 29" << endl;
  cout << "processCircle(17, 4)  returned " << processCircle(17, 4) << "  expected 5" << endl;
  cout << "processCircle(12, 73) returned " << processCircle(12, 73) << "  expected 9" << endl;

  return 0;
}

```

## Follow up questions

 Can this be written in a recursive/dynamic/iterative way?

 What happens if n & m are very large?

 What is the time/space complexity?
